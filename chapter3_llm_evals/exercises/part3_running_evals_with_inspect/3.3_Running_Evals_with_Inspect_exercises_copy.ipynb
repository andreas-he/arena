        "This section will introduce you to the process of running an evaluation using the `Inspect` library. This is a library that has been built by UK AISI for ease-of-use, and to standardise LLM evaluations. In this section, we'll actually get to run an evaluation on large language models, and notice the choices that can be made in eval design (how questions are presented, whether the model can use CoT, whether we use many-shot, few-shot, or zero-shot prompting etc.).\n",
        "\n",
        "Similarly to [3.1] and [3.2], most of our solutions will be built around the example **tendency to seek power** dataset. So you should approach the exercises with this in mind. You can either:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Use the same dataset as the solutions, and implement the evals that we run in the solutions. You could also extend this, and come up with your own evaluation procedure on this dataset.\n",
        "2. Use your own dataset for your chosen model property. For this, you will have to work through sections [3.1] and [3.2] and have a dataset of ~300 questions to use when you evaluate the LLMs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each exercise will have a difficulty and importance rating out of 5, as well as an estimated maximum time you should spend on these exercises and sometimes a short annotation. You should interpret the ratings & time estimates relatively (e.g. if you find yourself spending about 50% longer on the exercises than the time estimates, adjust accordingly). Please do skip exercises / look at solutions if you don't feel like they're important enough to be worth doing, and you'd rather get to the good stuff!"

This takes the form of a list of functions which add a step to the model's interaction with the question (e.g. doing chain of thought, generating a response to a new prompt, giving a final answer to a multiple choice question, etc). The collection of solvers is also sometimes called the `plan`.\n",

See for example [Narayanan & Kapoor: Does ChatGPT have a Liberal Bias?](https://www.aisnakeoil.com/p/does-chatgpt-have-a-liberal-bias) To mitigate this confounder, we should shuffle the choices (and answer) around when loading in the dataset.\n",

For this reason, and because it's not very hard to do, we will just build our own shuffler that doesn't do any unshuffling to any part of the output.\n",

We also may want to load without a system prompt when running an evaluation, so we can see how the model reacts to our questions when presented with a more generic \"You are a harmless, helpful, honest AI Chat Assistant\" system prompt (which we can then provide with our `system_message` solver)."
